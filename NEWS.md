 * Parse [YRA Decription of Marks](http://yra.org/descriptionofmarks/)
   content instead of [YRA Buoy Status](http://yra.org/buoy-status/)
   because the latter no longer has GPS coordinates of marks.
 * Renamed "YRA-30" to "YRA-NR6" because that is the name of that mark in
   [YRA Decription of Marks](http://yra.org/descriptionofmarks/).

**2017-02-06**

 * Updated YRA marks from yra.org web site
 * Ordered marks to be in sync with YRA
 * YRA-13 "Crissy Field Buoy" and YRA-TYC "Privately maintained White mark “TYC”
   off entrance to Paradise Cove Harbor" are missing because I do not know their
   location.  Email or merge requests more than welcome for this!

   list.  Note that this resulted in a re-ordering of marks.

**2015-09-16**

 * Replaced the text formats for DMS, DMM with CSV files
 * Dropped MD format as Github now displays CVS files nicely
 * dropped DDD format as this was identical to CSV
 * Now using gpsbabel-1.5 (which no longer uses `&apros;` for `'` in GPX)
 * `/gpx/time` in GPX is now set to modification time of CSV file instead of
   conversion time
